# Turbo streams can be broadcasted directly from models that include this module (this is automatically done for Active Records if ActiveJob is loaded).
# This makes it convenient to execute both synchronous and asynchronous updates, and render directly from callbacks in models
# or from controllers or jobs that act on those models. Here's an example:
#
#   class Clearance < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :petitioner, class_name: "Contact"
#     belongs_to :examiner,   class_name: "User"
#
#     after_create_commit :broadcast_later
#
#     private
#       def broadcast_later
#         broadcast_prepend_later_to examiner.identity, :clearances
#       end
#   end
#
# This is an example from {HEY}[https://hey.com], and the clearance is the model that drives
# {the screener}[https://hey.com/features/the-screener/], which gives users the power to deny first-time senders (petitioners)
# access to their attention (as the examiner). When a new clearance is created upon receipt of an email from a first-time
# sender, that'll trigger the call to broadcast_later, which in turn invokes <tt>broadcast_prepend_later_to</tt>.
#
# That method enqueues a <tt>Turbo::Streams::ActionBroadcastJob</tt> for the prepend, which will render the partial for clearance
# (it knows which by calling Clearance#to_partial_path, which in this case returns <tt>clearances/_clearance.html.erb</tt>),
# send that to all users that have subscribed to updates (using <tt>turbo_stream_from(examiner.identity, :clearances)</tt> in a view)
# using the <tt>Turbo::StreamsChannel</tt> under the stream name derived from <tt>[ examiner.identity, :clearances ]</tt>,
# and finally prepend the result of that partial rendering to the target identified with the dom id "clearances"
# (which is derived by default from the plural model name of the model, but can be overwritten).
#
# You can also choose to render html instead of a partial inside of a broadcast
# you do this by passing the +html:+ option to any broadcast method that accepts the **rendering argument. Example:
#
#   class Message < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :user
#
#     after_create_commit :update_message_count
#
#     private
#       def update_message_count
#         broadcast_update_to(user, :messages, target: "message-count", html: "<p> #{user.messages.count} </p>")
#       end
#   end
#
# If you want to render a template instead of a partial, e.g. ('messages/index' or 'messages/show'), you can use the +template:+ option.
# Again, only to any broadcast method that accepts the +**rendering+ argument. Example:
#
#   class Message < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :user
#
#     after_create_commit :update_message
#
#     private
#       def update_message
#         broadcast_replace_to(user, :message, target: "message", template: "messages/show", locals: { message: self })
#       end
#   end
#
# If you want to render a renderable object you can use the +renderable:+ option.
#
#   class Message < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :user
#
#     after_create_commit :update_message
#
#     private
#       def update_message
#         broadcast_replace_to(user, :message, target: "message", renderable: MessageComponent.new)
#       end
#   end
#
# There are seven basic actions you can broadcast: <tt>after</tt>, <tt>append</tt>, <tt>before</tt>,
# <tt>prepend</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>replace</tt>, and
# <tt>update</tt>. As a rule, you should use the <tt>_later</tt> versions of everything except for remove when broadcasting
# within a real-time path, like a controller or model, since all those updates require a rendering step, which can slow down
# execution. You don't need to do this for remove, since only the dom id for the model is used.
#
# In addition to the seven basic actions, you can also use <tt>broadcast_render</tt>,
# <tt>broadcast_render_to</tt> <tt>broadcast_render_later</tt>, and <tt>broadcast_render_later_to</tt>
# to render a turbo stream template with multiple actions.
#
# == Page refreshes
#
# You can broadcast "page refresh" stream actions. This will make subscribed clients reload the
# page. For pages that configure morphing and scroll preservation, this will translate into smooth
# updates when it only updates the content that changed.
#
# This approach is an alternative to fine-grained stream actions targeting specific DOM elements. It
# offers good fidelity with a much simpler programming model. As a tradeoff, the fidelity you can reach
# is often not as high as with targeted stream actions since it renders the entire page again.
#
# The +broadcasts_refreshes+ class method configures the model to broadcast a "page refresh" on creates,
# updates, and destroys to a stream name derived at runtime by the <tt>stream</tt> symbol invocation. Examples
#
#   class Board < ApplicationRecord
#     broadcasts_refreshes
#   end
#
# In this example, when a board is created, updated, or destroyed, a Turbo Stream for a
# page refresh will be broadcasted to all clients subscribed to the "boards" stream.
#
# This works great in hierarchical structures, where the child record touches parent records automatically
# to invalidate the cache:
#
#   class Column < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :board, touch: true # +Board+ will trigger a page refresh on column changes
#   end
#
# You can also specify the streamable declaratively by passing a symbol to the +broadcasts_refreshes_to+ method:
#
#   class Column < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :board
#     broadcasts_refreshes_to :board
#   end
#
# For more granular control, you can also broadcast a "page refresh" to a stream name derived
# from the passed <tt>streamables</tt> by using the instance-level methods <tt>broadcast_refresh_to</tt> or
# <tt>broadcast_refresh_later_to</tt>. These methods are particularly useful when you want to trigger
# a page refresh for more specific scenarios. Example:
#
#   class Clearance < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :petitioner, class_name: "Contact"
#     belongs_to :examiner,   class_name: "User"
#
#     after_create_commit :broadcast_refresh_later
#
#     private
#       def broadcast_refresh_later
#         broadcast_refresh_later_to examiner.identity, :clearances
#       end
#   end
#
# In this example, a "page refresh" is broadcast to the stream named "identity:<identity-id>:clearances"
# after a new clearance is created. All clients subscribed to this stream will refresh the page to reflect
# the changes.
#
# When broadcasting page refreshes, Turbo will automatically debounce multiple calls in a row to only broadcast the last one.
# This is meant for scenarios where you process records in mass. Because of the nature of such signals, it makes no sense to
# broadcast them repeatedly and individually.
# == Suppressing broadcasts
#
# Sometimes, you need to disable broadcasts in certain scenarios. You can use <tt>.suppressing_turbo_broadcasts</tt> to create
# execution contexts where broadcasts are disabled:
#
#   class Message < ApplicationRecord
#     after_create_commit :update_message
#
#     private
#       def update_message
#         broadcast_replace_to(user, :message, target: "message", renderable: MessageComponent.new)
#       end
#   end
#
#   Message.suppressing_turbo_broadcasts do
#     Message.create!(board: board) # This won't broadcast the replace action
#   end
