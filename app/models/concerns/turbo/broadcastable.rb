# Turbo updates can be broadcast directly from models that include this module (this is automatically done for Active Records).
# This makes it convenient to execute both synchronous and asynchronous updates, and render directly from callbacks in models
# or from controllers or jobs that act on those models. Here's an example:
#
#   class Clearance < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :petitioner, class_name: "Contact"
#     belongs_to :examiner,   class_name: "User"
#
#     after_create_commit :broadcast_later
#
#     private
#       def broadcast_later
#         broadcast_prepend_later_to examiner.identity, :clearances
#       end
#   end
#
# This is an example from [HEY](https://hey.com), and the clearance is the model that drives
# [the screener](https://hey.com/features/the-screener/), which gives users the power to deny first-time senders (petitioners)
# access to their attention (as the examiner). When a new clearance is created upon receipt of an email from a first-time
# sender, that'll trigger the call to broadcast_later, which in turn invokes <tt>broadcast_prepend_later_to</tt>.
#
# That method enqueues a <tt>Turbo::Updates::BroadcastJob</tt>, which will render the partial for clearance (it knows which
# by calling Clearance#to_partial_path, which in this case returns <tt>clearances/_clearance.html.erb</tt>), send that to
# all users that have subscribed to updates (using
# <tt>subscribe_to_turbo_stream_from_signed(examiner.identity, :clearances)</tt> in a view) using the
# <tt>Turbo::StreamChannel</tt> under the stream name derived from <tt>[ examiner.identity, :clearances ]</tt>,
# and finally prepend the result of that partial rendering to the container identified with the dom id "clearances"
# (which is derived by default from the plural model name of the model, but can be overwritten).
#
# There are four basic types of updates you can broadcast: <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>replace</tt>, <tt>append</tt>, and
# <tt>prepend</tt>. As a rule, you should use the <tt>_later</tt> versions of everything except for remove when broadcasting
# within a real-time path, like a controller or model, since all those updates require a rendering step, which can slow down
# execution. You don't need to do this for remove, since only the dom id for the model is used.
#
# In addition to the four basic types of updates that execute a single page update command, you can also use
# <tt>broadcast_render_later</tt> or <tt>broadcast_render_later_to</tt> to render a page update template with multiple
# commands.

  module ClassMethods
    # Configures the model to broadcast creates, updates, and destroys to a stream name derived at runtime by the
    # <tt>stream</tt> symbol invocation. By default, the creates are appended to a dom id container name derived from
    # the model's plural name. The insertion can also be made to be a prepend by overwriting <tt>insertion</tt> and
    # the container dom id overwritten by passing <tt>container</tt>. Examples:
    #
    #   class Message < ApplicationRecord
    #     belongs_to :board
    #     broadcasts_to :board
    #   end
    #
